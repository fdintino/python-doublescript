python-doublescript
===================

python-doublescript is a package that allows runtime manipulation of the
evaluated value of "2 + 2" (generally to cause the result to equal "5").
The name of the package and the specific focus on "2 + 2" comes from the novel
*1984* by George Orwell, but the motivation is to explore CPython internals
and how one would go about monkey-patching those internals at runtime using
ctypes.
